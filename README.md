# Collection View Mac Issue

[![Issue Status](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/detail/state/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/13289)](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/13289)

Sample repository for using a `Xamarin.Forms.CollectionView` in MacOS. I currently believe this component to be either bugged or not support by the platform. I have created a sample with an example of multiple types of repeating layouts to demonstrate the issue.

There are some videos and gifs in the `/Assets` folder of this repo to demostrate the current issue:
